# CPSC-281-Trouble
This is our data structures class final project. The goal of the project was to create something from scratch that utilizes a data structure and places an emphasis on it. In our case, we opted to create trouble and have a decision tree emulate an opponent. 
The game can be played with 4 real players where 1-4 of the players can be replaced with our AI.
